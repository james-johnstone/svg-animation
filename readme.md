Project Description
Hi,

We need to animate 5 SVG images for a dashboard html page. These animations must have 4 scales of "speed" like I'm going to discuss here.

The SUN image need to have:

- An animation that will mean NO SUN.

- An animation that will mean a LITTLE SUN.

- An animation that will mean a MEDIUM SUN.

- An animation that will mean a HOT SUN.

These status (or scales) must be set using or CSS class or a javascript function, like:

setSun([0,1,5,10])

For the SUN, we want it to rotate too (and PULSE) when it has at least a LITTLE SUN. The colors must be changed also that will mean the power of the sun (scale from yellow to hot red). When reached MAXIMUM, an animation that will translate that its required too.

The thermometer must have the same scales as SUN, and the meter should go UP with color changing also.

The LIGHT BULB should have an animation that will feel it's power from bottom to up, and when it's FULL, the "lightning" sign should pulse constantly with a different color than the bulb.

The "ecologism-nine-squares-areas" image should fill each square as the scales goes up, and when it's set to MAXIMUM, it should animate with some kind of PULSE too (use your imagination).

The "ecological-tool-for-winds-to-generate-energy" image should blow the wind (according to the scale) and the windmill should spin too following the scale. Some kind of animation when MAXIMUM it's reached must be done too.

Bottom of line, you can do these imaginations using CSS or javascript (readable one). If using the last method, functions should be provided to set the scale (power).

A pattern of colors should be used 'cause all of these images will be displayed in the same page so we want to follow a standard here.

If you have any doubts feel free to contact me.
